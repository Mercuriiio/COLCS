# COLCS
## A novel contrastive-learning-based deep neural network for cancer subtypes identification by integrating multi-omics data
## Introduction
We introduced an end-to-end contrastive-learning-based deep neural network called COLCS, to distinguish the subtypes of the patients with the same tumor. By applying to nine cancer datasets, the experiments show COLCS outperformed the existing methods and can get biologically meaningful cancer subtype labels for cancer-related gene identification.
